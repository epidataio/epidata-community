EpiData
=====================================
EpiData is an integrated IoT Analytics Platform. It enables smarter industrial solutions including energy management, building automation and smart manufacturing. 


Required Components
--------------------
Apache Cassandra  
Apache Kafka  
Apache Spark  
Jupyter Notebook  


Installation and Launch
------------------------
- Docker Container:
The epidata-community docker image is available as a stand-alone package with all code and required components. To build and start a docker container, simply execute the command shown below (replacing 'epidata123' with a custom token):  
    - docker run -p 443:443 -it -e token=epidata123 epidataio/epidata-community:0.11.0

    Below are other useful docker commands:
    - Pull the docker image: 
        - docker pull epidataio/epidata-community:0.11.0
    - List all docker containers:
        - docker ps -a
    - Stop a docker container:
        - docker stop <container_id>
    - Start a stopped docker container:
        - docker start <container_id>
    - Start epidata application on a running container:
        - docker exec -it <container_id> ./epidata-start.sh -p 443:443


- Installation Scripts:
One can also set up EpiData plaform by followig the installation and launch scripts available in epidata-install repository. We recommend cloning epidata-community repository to epidata folder within ubuntu user's home directory (/home/ubuntu).


Configuration
--------------
- Authentication: 
Access to EpiData platform is managed via tokens and OAuth 2 authorization (with GitHub). The configuration settings for tokens are available in play/conf/application.conf, and OAuth 2 are available in play/conf/securesocial.conf. Authenticated users can be added to the system manually via Cassandra's CQL commands.

- Measurement Class:
Epidata can be configured to operate on 'sensor measurement' or 'automated test' data. To enable sensor measurement data, play's application.conf must set measurement-class to sensor_measurement. In addition, spark's spark-defaults.conf must set spark.epidata.measurementClass to sensor_measurement. To enable automated test data, play's application.conf must set measurement-class to automated_test. In addition, spark's spark-defaults.conf must set spark.epidata.measurementClass to automated_test. 


Usage
------
After launch, EpiData platform is ready to ingest and process sensor data. To access ingestion scripts and Jupyter Notebook tutorial, you can visit https://<epidata_url>, where epidata_url is the url for the server hosting EpiData.
